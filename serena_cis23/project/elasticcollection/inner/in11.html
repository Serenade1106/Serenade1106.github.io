<h2>"The one I love, tonight I don't care about humans. <br/>I only know that I miss you."<br/>The person the author loves is older than he is, <br/>so he chooses to call her his sister. <br/>The fact that he doesn't care about humans means <br/>that he doesn't care about everything in the world.<br/>He only cares and misses the person he loves.
