<h4>The Couple's Retreat Garden, also known as Ouyuan Garden, is one of the most famous classical gardens in Suzhou, China. It was built during the Ming Dynasty in the 16th century and was originally a private garden for a wealthy government official. The garden has since changed hands multiple times and was renamed "Couple's Retreat Garden" during the Qing Dynasty.

    <br>
    The garden covers an area of about 0.6 hectares and is divided into three main sections: the eastern, central, and western sections. The eastern section is the entrance to the garden and features a small courtyard with a rockery and several pavilions. The central section is the main part of the garden and is characterized by its water features, bridges, and rock formations. The western section is the most peaceful and secluded part of the garden and contains several buildings and courtyards.

    The Couple's Retreat Garden is known for its many picturesque features, including a variety of rock formations, winding streams and ponds, and beautifully manicured plants and trees. One of the most famous features of the garden is the "Flying Rock", a large rock perched on the side of a cliff that appears to be flying through the air.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another notable feature of the garden is the "Lotus Flower Cave", a small grotto that is said to have been carved from living rock. The cave contains several inscriptions and poems, as well as a small pool filled with lotus flowers.
