    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>think the site is divided into three main broad areas.    <br/>
        <br/>

    1: the moderation area.    <br/>
    People can customize their desired font model's shape, size, and angle by adjusting all the values in the adjustment area.    <br/>
    <br/>
    2: Input area.    <br/>
    You can customize different font shapes by inputting the text you want to express in the input area. <br/>
    <br/>
    3:The display area. <br/>
    The largest area of the screen is the display area. The display area clearly shows the final composite graphic to the user. <br/>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>
        I really like this site, it's a great way to see a lot of different shapes of fonts quickly compared to having to adjust the size, <br/>
        design, and orientation of fonts on your computer over and over again. Although the site doesn't seem to be difficult to structure,<br/>
         I am curious about how to input user-defined content into the site, and how we can achieve this effect.
